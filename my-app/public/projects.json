    "description": "For Closet Pioneers, I undertook the task of redesigning the theme and layout of their website. The previous website was outdated and poorly developed, which led to a lack of customer engagement and ultimately required the owner to reconsider their strategy. I worked closely with the client for a period of six months, testing ideas, layouts, and themes until we arrived at a satisfactory solution.Upon completion of the website redesign, the client observed a significant improvement in user retention, with a 25% increase, as well as a 15% increase in orders placed. Additionally, I took charge of running Facebook ad campaigns for the client for three months. During this time, I custom designed and deployed three different ads, which resulted in a total exposure to over 50,000 people, and the acquisition of 100 new referral orders. ",
